<blockquote><p>A local businessman who arrived at the restaurant after the incident said he was told about the gunshot by a restaurant employee.<br />
According to that account, a deputy who had been at the restaurant for lunch accidentally discharged his weapon while he was in the men&rsquo;s restroom.<br />
The shot reportedly went through the restroom ceiling, where there is a bullet hole.<br />
Several people inside the restaurant apparently heard the shot.<br />
According to the businessman, who asked to remain anonymous, the restaurant employee asked the deputy what the noise was and the deputy allegedly replied, &ldquo;The toilet seat fell, making the noise.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And with that, (the deputy) proceeded to walk out of the restaurant,&rdquo; the businessman said. &ldquo;He lied to the waitress on his way out the door, according to her.&rdquo;<br />
A member of management with IHOP reportedly followed the deputy into the parking lot. The IHOP representative &ldquo;confronted (the deputy) on the parking lot and then he &lsquo;fessed up to it,&rdquo; the employee said.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a big college basketball fan and had never did a bracket, but I figured &ldquo;What the heck?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I decided the folks who seeded the tournament were much more knowledgable than I about the rankings of teams, so I simply chose the higher seeded team in each game.  When it came down to the final four, and I had 4 #1 seeds, I had to make a decision.  Who&rsquo;s it going to be?  I went with Florida and Ohio St. in the championship game, and it happened to work out that way.  Since Florida was last year&rsquo;s champ, I decided to go with them to win the championship again this year.  Good plan.</p>
<p>Going into the championship game, I was tied for 1st in our group.  I picked the Gators and the other guy picked Ohio St.  Needless to say, I won in our group, and actually placed very well overall on Yahoo.  I ranked in the top 97% in position 45717. I know there were at least 1.4 million brackets on Yahoo, because the last place finisher in our group was ranked 1,474,170.</p>
<p>Beginner&rsquo;s luck, I guess.</p>
<p>In other college basketball news&hellip; <a href="http://hogwired.com/">Arkansas</a> hired a new Men&rsquo;s basketball coach yesterday:  <a href="http://www.gocreighton.com/items_of_interest/bios.asp?BiosID=68">Dana Altman</a> of <a href="http://www2.creighton.edu/">Creighton Univeristy</a>.  Today, <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/cbk/story/6640996">Altman had a change of heart</a> and went back to Creighton, leaving Arkansas high and dry.</p>
<p>Altman says he made the decison to go back because of his family and loyalty to Creighton. He said his ego got in the way and he accepted the job at Arkansas because he was selfish.  I admire the guy for making the tough decision to swallow his pride and ask for his old job back.  However, he made the right decision at the wrong time.  The correct time for that type of decision would have been sometime before he &ldquo;<a href="http://arkalum.org/traditions/callingthehogs.php">called the hogs</a>&rdquo; at the press conference introducing him as the new coach.  I hope he plans on spending the rest of his career at Creighton because he&rsquo;ll have a hard time getting another school to even talk to him after this fiasco.</p>
<p>I have to wonder&hellip;  Was the whole Dana Altman thing just a smoke screen cooked up by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Broyles">Frank Broyles</a> to keep the press busy while he hammered out the details with <a href="http://www.gatorzone.com/billydonovan/">Billy Donovan</a> (Florida Gators head coach)?  It would be amazing to get a big time coach like that, but Arkansas would be more likely to hire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Richardson">Nolan Richardson</a> back than to get Donovan.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.hogwired.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=30746&amp;SPID=2421&amp;DB_OEM_ID=6100&amp;ATCLID=847623">University of Arkansas website</a>, they are hiring a national search firm to find the next coach.</p>";s:11:"description";s:346:"A couple weeks ago, my father-in-law asked if I was interested in filling out a bracket and joining his Yahoo! group for the NCAA Men&#8217;s  Basketball tournament.

Turns out they wouldn&rsquo;t have been crazy after all.</p>
<p>Jan 15th, I weighed in at a hefty 198.4 lbs.  Today: a much slimmer 178lbs.</p>
<p>How did I do it? Hmm. Good question.  I started off with incentive.  We&rsquo;re having a &ldquo;Wellness Sweepstakes&rdquo; at work.  It&rsquo;s based on <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/">body mass index (BMI)</a>, and we weigh in every 2 weeks.  For each .5 BMI decrease we get 1 sweepstakes entry (max 1 entry per weigh in).</p>
<p>If you are already within the &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; range on the BMI scale, you get a entry at every weigh in.  At the end of the contest, all the entries are put in a hat and winners are drawn.  The more entries you have, the more likely you are to win.  Top prize:  A trip for 2 to any state we operate in.  Can you say &ldquo;Hawaii&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Once my incentive was established, I started by eliminating Mt. Dew from my diet. I also stopped eating 3 helpings at dinner and snacking on junk food throughout the day.</p>
<p>To this, I added a little walking to my daily routine. I started at a mile several times per week, and am up to 2.5 miles 6-7 times per week.</p>
<p>A combination of all these things amounted to some pretty significant weight loss in a relatively short period of time.  No TrimSpa, Anatrim, or any other pharmaceuticals required.</p>
<p>As of today, I now fall within the &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; BMI range.  All I have to do from here on is maintain my existing weight.  That should be easy enough, right?  I hovered at 200 lbs before I started dieting/excerising, so I should be able to go back to my old ways without gaining weight.  Oh.  It doesn&rsquo;t work that way?  Ugh.  Oh well.

<p><strong>A little history&hellip;</strong><br />
I bought this car the summer before my senior year of high school in 1995.  Prior to being purchased by 16 year old me, it had been a Hertz rental car. I drove it all thru high school and college, then parked it in August 2000 when I landed my first professional job and bought a new 2000 Grand Prix.</p>
<p>6 years of sitting out in the weather had not been kind to the Monte, and the car was in pretty bad shape.  Now that we&rsquo;ve done all of this work to get her presentable again, she should remain in good shape for many years to come.</p>
