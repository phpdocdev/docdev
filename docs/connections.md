# Connections ðŸš¥

## Email
By default all email sent from PHP is "caught" by [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog). This allows you to review the emails being sent without the system actually delivering them to real email addresses.

You can view anything which has been sent and caught via [http://localhost:8025/](http://localhost:8025/).

| Parameter | Value |
|-------------|---|
| Host | `mailhog` |
| Port | `1025` |
| Username | `testuser` |
| Password | `testpwd` |

---

## MySQL
You can connect to the MySQL server running in the container using [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), [Navicat](https://www.navicat.com/) or [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/).

| Parameter | Value |
|-------------|---|
| Connection | Standard TCP/IP |
| Host | `mysql` (from a container) OR `localhost` (from your computer) |
| Port | `3306` |
| Username | `root` |
| Password | `dbroot` (this can be changed in `.env`) |

Alternatively you can add `127.0.0.1 mysql` to your hosts file so that the `mysql` hostname will work either from your host machine or from the docker containers (useful for CLI tools like Laravel's `artisan` command).

QUICK FIX: If you ever break the ownership settings on your Docker MariaDB Data folder, simply exec into the mysql container and run the foloowing command:
`chown -R root:mysql /var/lib/mysql/*`

| Parameter | Value |

| Host | `redis` (from a container) OR `localhost` (from your computer) |
